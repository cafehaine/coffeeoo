# CoffeeOO
## What is CoffeeOO
CoffeeOO is my own lua object oriented library. It implements inheritance,
allows overriding operators, and comes with a few built-in classes.

## How to use it
See the minecraft-inspired exemples in the exemples directory.
They show how to create classes, instantiate objects, and basic inheritance.
